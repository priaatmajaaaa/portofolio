The Company information API by Finnworlds gives developers instant access to a comprehensive and structured company details database. With a single API call, you can look up companies using their stock ticker, ISIN number or other identifiers and retrieve a full profile enriched with business metadata. This includes industry and sector classification, executive leadership, full descriptions, IPO dates, employee count, contact details, and more.

Designed to save time and infrastructure costs, this company information data API eliminates the need to build and maintain your own company database. Whether you're creating financial platforms, stock screeners, research tools, or portfolio trackers, the API allows you to deliver rich and current business profiles with minimal setup with its REST structure.

The API is ideal for investment analytics, enterprise applications, or fintech platforms that require accurate and current information on public companies worldwide. With high-frequency updates and global coverage, this API is a reliable data source for any use case where company intelligence matters.
